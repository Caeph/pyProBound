# pyProBound
Python package for scoring sequences by a ProBound model

This is an interface package to score sequences by models of transcription factor affinity produced by ProBound (Rube, H.T., Rastogi, C., Feng, S. et al. Prediction of protein–ligand binding affinity from sequencing data with interpretable machine learning. Nat Biotechnol 40, 1520–1527 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01307-0). 

This is only an interface. The functional part of the scoring is provided by a (sligthly modified) ProBoundTools Java program available from https://github.com/Caeph/ProBoundTools.git. The original program can be found at https://github.com/BussemakerLab/ProBoundTools. 

## Instalation
Not done yet. Pip package planned.

## Usage
